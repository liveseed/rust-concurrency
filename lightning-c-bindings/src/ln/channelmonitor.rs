//! The logic to monitor for on-chain transactions and create the relevant claim responses lives
//! here.
//!
//! ChannelMonitor objects are generated by ChannelManager in response to relevant
//! messages/actions, and MUST be persisted to disk (and, preferably, remotely) before progress can
//! be made in responding to certain messages, see ManyChannelMonitor for more.
//!
//! Note that ChannelMonitors are an important part of the lightning trust model and a copy of the
//! latest ChannelMonitor must always be actively monitoring for chain updates (and no out-of-date
//! ChannelMonitors should do so). Thus, if you're building rust-lightning into an HSM or other
//! security-domain-separated system design, you should consider having multiple paths for
//! ChannelMonitors to get out of the HSM and onto monitoring devices.

	/// submitting new commitment transactions to the remote party. Once the update(s) which failed
	/// have been successfully applied, ChannelManager::channel_monitor_updated can be used to
	/// restore the channel to an operational state.
	///
	/// Note that a given ChannelManager will *never* re-generate a given ChannelMonitorUpdate. If
	/// you return a TemporaryFailure you must ensure that it is written to disk safely before
	/// writing out the latest ChannelManager state.
	///
	/// Even when a channel has been \"frozen\" updates to the ChannelMonitor can continue to occur
	/// (eg if an inbound HTLC which we forwarded was claimed upstream resulting in us attempting
	/// to claim it on this channel) and those updates must be applied wherever they can be. At
	/// least one such updated ChannelMonitor must be persisted otherwise PermanentFailure should
	/// be returned to get things on-chain ASAP using only the in-memory copy. Obviously updates to
	/// the channel which would invalidate previous ChannelMonitors are not made when a channel has
	/// been \"frozen\".
	///
	/// Note that even if updates made after TemporaryFailure succeed you must still call
	/// channel_monitor_updated to ensure you have the latest monitor and re-enable normal channel
	/// operation.
	///
	/// Note that the update being processed here will not be replayed for you when you call
	/// ChannelManager::channel_monitor_updated, so you must store the update itself along
	/// with the persisted ChannelMonitor on your own local disk prior to returning a
	/// TemporaryFailure. You may, of course, employ a journaling approach, storing only the
	/// ChannelMonitorUpdate on disk without updating the monitor itself, replaying the journal at
	/// reload-time.
	///
	/// For deployments where a copy of ChannelMonitors and other local state are backed up in a
	/// remote location (with local copies persisted immediately), it is anticipated that all
	/// updates will return TemporaryFailure until the remote copies could be updated.
	TemporaryFailure,
