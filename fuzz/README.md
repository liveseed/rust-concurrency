# Fuzzing

Fuzz tests generate a ton of random parameter arguments to the program and then validate that none cause it to crash.

## How does it work?

Typically, Travis CI will run `travis-fuzz.sh` on one of the environments the automated tests are configured for.
This is the most time-consuming component of the continuous integration workflow, so it is recommended that you detect
issues locally, and Travis merely acts as a sanity check.

## How do I run fuzz tests locally?

You typically won't need to run the entire combination of different fuzzing tools. For local execution, `honggfuzz`
should be more than sufficient. 

### Setup

To install `honggfuzz`, simply run

```shell
cargo install honggfuzz --force

export HFUZZ_BUILD_ARGS="--features honggfuzz_fuzz"
cargo hfuzz build
```

### Execution

To run the Hongg fuzzer, do

```shell
export CPU_COUNT=1 # replace as needed
export HFUZZ_RUN_ARGS="-n $CPU_COUNT --exit_upon_crash"

export TARGET="" # replace with the target to be fuzzed
cargo hfuzz run $TARGET 
```

## A fuzz test failed on Travis, what do I do?

You're trying to create a PR, but need to find the underlying cause of that pesky fuzz failure blocking the merge?

Worry not, for this is easily traced.

If your Travis output log looks like this:

```
Size:639 (i,b,hw,ed,ip,cmp): 0/0/0/0/0/1, Tot:0/0/0/2036/5/28604
Seen a crash. Terminating all fuzzing threads

The command "if [ "$(rustup show | grep default | grep stable)" != "" ]; then cd fuzz && cargo test --verbose && ./travis-fuzz.sh; fi" exited with 1.
```

Simply copy the hex, and run the following from the `fuzz` directory:

```shell
export HEX="2d3136383734090101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101\
010101010100040101010101010101010101010103010101010100010101\
0069d07c319a4961" # adjust for your output
echo $HEX | xxd -r -p > ./test_cases/full_stack/your_test_case_name

export RUST_BACKTRACE=1
cargo test
```

This will reproduce the failing fuzz input and yield a usable stack trace.
